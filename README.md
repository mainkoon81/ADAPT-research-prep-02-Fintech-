### I. Robo-Advising
> Before Robo-Advisor
 - __For Rich:__ They would have investment portfolios and traditional advisors. So they'd be managing this portfolio of their money for themselves, for their family, for their retirement, and so on.
 - __For others:__ They wouldn't have financial advisors, or wouldn't even really be saving for their retirement so much. Instead, they depended on social security or pension plans such as "Defined Benefit Plan" and the pension was set by the formula, counting up the years of service.
   - Traditionally...**Insolvency Everywhere**...
     - The benefit came at a cost
     - Employers should maintain assets sufficient for the liabilities..but do they do? GM? Chrysler? 
     - No guarantee of reliable delivery??? What are we going to do about the solvency of the pension plans? 
   - So these days, we were transitioning out of those DBP into "Defined Contribution Plans" - There was a promise there, you're going to get this benefits!
     - `401K Plan`
       - :The tax code encourages "Do-it-Yourself retirement savings".
       - :A sort of **"pre-tax"** (at the end of the month, money is taken out of my paycheck) goes into the mutual funds and then my employer also pitches in some money too. All that money goes into the mutual funds..then it grows...hopefully
       - :when I reach retirement, I've got my social security but on top of that, wherever this ends up, that's what I've got. That's what's standard.

### But How to help ordinary people for "Do it Yourself retirement savings"? How to help them come up with their own investment plan?
